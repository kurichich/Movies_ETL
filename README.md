# Movies_ETL

## Project Overview
The Amazing Prime video team would like to develop an algorythm to predict which low budget films will be popular, so they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain.   They decided to host a hackathon and provide a clean set of data for participants to use in the contest.   The dataset includes a list of movies released since 1990, provided by Wikipedia, and set of movie ratings from another data source.

The goal is to extract the data from both datasets, clean and transform the data, and load the results into a Sequel database.
